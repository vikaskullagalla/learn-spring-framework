@Component is the most generic stereotype annotation applicable for any class or bean
    - This is the base for all stereotype annotations

Specilizations of @Component are:
    @Service - Indicates an annotated class has Business Logic
    @Repository - Indicates an annotated class is used for data manipulate from database
    @Controller - Indicates an annotated class is used for web requests

Use the most specific stereotype annotation possible.
