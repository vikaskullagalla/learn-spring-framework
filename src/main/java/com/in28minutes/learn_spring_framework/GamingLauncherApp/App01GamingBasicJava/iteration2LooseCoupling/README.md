Iteration2 - Loose Coupling
To introduce loose coupling we will use GameRunner -> Gaming Console -> MarioGame, SuperContraGame
GameRunner is decoupled from the games
Here, Gaming Console will run the games rather than GameRunner
This is called as loose coupling
Also, GamingConsole can run any game now
